# Event-Based-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
In today's financial markets, news headlines play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment and influencing investor decisions. The "Event-Driven Trading Signals based on News Headlines" project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract actionable insights from news headlines and translate them into trading signals.
    By analysing historical data from the S&P BSE SENSEX and news headlines from Times of India, we seek to uncover patterns between news sentiment and stock price movements. This project holds significant implications for traders, investors, and financial institutions seeking to make informed decisions in dynamic market conditions.
